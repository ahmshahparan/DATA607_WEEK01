Mushrooms Dataset. A famous—if slightly moldy—dataset about mushrooms can be found in the UCI repository here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom. The fact that this is such a well-known dataset in the data science community makes it a good dataset to use for comparative benchmarking. For example, if someone was working to build a better decision tree algorithm (or other predictive classifier) to analyze categorical data, this dataset could be useful. A typical problem (which is beyond the scope of this assignment!) is to answer the question, “Which other attribute or attributes are the best predictors of whether a particular mushroom is poisonous or edible?”
